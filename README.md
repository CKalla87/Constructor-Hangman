# Constructor-Hangman
This is a word guess command-line game using constructor functions.

1. When prompted to enter a letter, press any letter (A-Z) on the keyboard to guess a letter.

2. Keep guessing letters. When you guess a letter, your choice is either correct or incorrect.

3. If incorrect, the letter you guessed does not appear in the word.

4. For every incorrect guess, the number of guesses remaining decrease by 1.

5. If correct, the letter you guessed appears in the word.

6. If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before the number of guesses remaining reaches 0, you win.

7. If you run out of guesses before the entire word is revealed, you lose. Game over.

8. You can exit the game at any time by pressing Ctrl + C on your keyboard.

9. Please make sure to download the npm packages before you play the game.

Good luck!
